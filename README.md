# HubPets
A minecraft bukkit/spigot plugin that creates pets in your minecraft server.

Why use HubPets?
--------

HubPets is a better/less laggier alternative to most other pet plugins. If your looking for a simple way of adding extra perks into your server, then this plugin is right for you.

HubPets is basically a better alternative than EchoPets, however there are some requirements:

* **HubPets requires Java 8 or higher.** On older versions, the plugin may not work properly.

* **HubPets supports Minecraft versions 1.13.1+, 1.14.X, 1.15.X, and 1.16.2+. HOWEVER If you would like minecraft 1.8.X - 1.16.X compatiability, you would need to use ProtocolSupport or any alternative plugin that lets older clients connect to a newer server.**
